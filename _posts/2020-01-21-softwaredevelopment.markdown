I want to learn software development because I feel like this is where I belong. I am been coding for about 6 months now, and I feel as though I need guidance. Learning from the right people can really drive my life in the right direction. I learned of my love for coding around June, when I started a job working with computers. I started to troubleshoot computers, and I felt as though I was where I needed to be. I first started learning through team treehouse. I soon moved on to udemy courses. Now I am here!
